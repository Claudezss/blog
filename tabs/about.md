## About Me 

**Yan (Claude) Zhang**,  Softweare Engnieer with  Electical Engineering background 



Currently I'm working as a  Software Engineer in Test in [Opus One solutions](https://www.opusonesolutions.com/).

My previous role is full stack developer in Greensfiled Supply Chain. I developed a visualized supply chain management/tracking system (react, django, mysql, gcp) and a B2B shipping website (php)



### My Motto

> To the time to life, rather than to life in time
